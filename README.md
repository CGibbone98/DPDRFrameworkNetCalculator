# DPDRFrameworkNetCalculator
This is a calculator coded in C# using the .NET framework for Data Structures and Algorithms

All you have to do in order to run the program is click the file called "NetCalculator.exe"

You then have to click "View Raw"
You'll see the program automatically download to your computer. Since it is a .exe file, Windows may give you a message such as "This file
may be harmful to your computer" or something along the lines. Click the arrow pointing up next to it, and click "Keep."

Click the file in the downloads again, and then you may get a message saying "Windows protected your PC." You will then see an option that says
"More Info" where Windows Defender will give you a message basically stating that this may be a harmful file. Since you clicked More Info,
you will be able to click an option that says "Run Anyway."

My application should now be able to open on your computer!
